Welcome to the LEWAS Lab Data Art Generator! 

This project was created by the LEWAS Lab as part of the Virginia Tech 2022 
Solving Problems with Data Science, funded by the National Science Foundation 
(NSF) Grant # 1922516. The project was created with the intent of making the 
extensive LEWAS database more accessable to the general public. 

To use the LEWAS Lab Data Art Generator, users can download the LEWAS data of
their choice at http://owls.lewas.ictas.vt.edu/single_graph.html. Then, users
can run the file CSVCleaner to resample and clean the LEWAS data. Depending on
the extent of the data, this process may take a few minutes. After this, users
can run the main file. Use the option "--help" to see more information and 
options. 

Requirements:
The LEWAS Lab Data Art Generator requires the following software to run properly:
~ Python 3.10.5
~ Pandas 1.4.2
~ Pillow 9.1.1
~ NumPy 1.22.4
