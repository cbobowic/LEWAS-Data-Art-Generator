#Step 1: Need to prompt user for data
# - Have it run where the user initially provides some data path as a parameter
# - Make it interactive and have the user do stuff

#Step 2: We have the data
# - Data needs to be reduced somehow
#   - Either taking particular columns and assigning that to an array -> memory inefficient?
#   - The user possibly provides the data reduced at the start
#   - Libraries of interest - pandas
#   - Cap on the amount of data that the user can manipulate
# - Choose to make this generalized or specific for the LEWAS data

#Step 3: Generate images
# - What do we want it to look like? Shapes, lines
# - What aspects do we want to change? (Color, size, darkness, location/placement to indicate time?)
# - The datetime might need be converted into a value? But also ID so like hm?
# - Multiple types of images (different functions to show different things)
#   - Pick 1 or 2 attributes that correlate to a specific value that would be under each specific
#   function, determine which aspects can be changed by the user per function


#Step 4: Display
# - In what format should the images be output? (jpg png, etc.)
# - Effect of different attributes (salinity, etc.) on wildlife
# - Incorporate some way for the user to save their image
# - Pitch some sort of social media something #share...
